- Make sure the MongoDB Server is runnning. To check, go to Start and type `Services`. Look for the MongoDB server and make sure its running. If not, right click and select `Start`.

- For setting up MongoDB Compass, after connecting to `localhost:27017`, create a new Database `mutual_funds` with Collection name as `funds`.
